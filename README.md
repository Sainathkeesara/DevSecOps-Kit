## Who this is for

A working devops and devsecops engineer's quick-reference: first-contact notes, runnable snippets, and configs for the tools you reach for every day. Use it as a shelf you grab from, not a tutorial site. It deliberately does not try to replace each tool's official docs.

## What's in here

1084 files across 38 tool and content folders, plus cross-cutting docs, scripts, snippets, templates, and lab environments. The toolchain runs from Linux and Git fundamentals up through Kubernetes delivery, then into the security tooling that rides on top of it: Trivy, Syft, Grype, Checkov, tfsec, Terrascan, Semgrep, CodeQL, ZAP, Nuclei, SonarQube, Cosign, Falco, Tetragon, OPA, Vault, and the secret scanners. Every entry is scenario-grounded and designed to be adapted for real infrastructure work.

## Quick links

- [ZAP CI/CD pipeline DAST gate](zap/manifests/zap-cicd-pipeline.yaml) — Baseline scan on every pull request plus a full Automation Framework scan on pushes to main, failing the build on High findings
- [ZAP scan configuration migration guide](zap/docs/zap-scan-configuration-migration-guide.md) — Move scattered wrapper scripts and context files into one version-controlled Automation Framework plan
- [ZAP integration reference](zap/docs/zap-integration-reference.md) — Baseline, Automation Framework, and REST API patterns for wiring DAST into automated pipelines
- [Assets directory walkthrough](assets/notes/2026-09-30-explore-assets-directory.md) — What the diagram store holds today and how docs reference it
- [Minimal per-tier environments config](environments/configs/2026-09-30-minimal-environments-config.yaml) — Only the values that differ between dev, staging, and prod, with the intended state key per tier

## Layout

- **`00_index/`** — Navigation: topic map, quick links, glossary, learning path
- **`docs/`** — Concepts, how-to guides, reference, runbooks, security docs, troubleshooting, and setup guides
- **`scripts/`** — Shell toolkits organised by domain (`scripts/bash/`), deployment and rollback wrappers (`scripts/pipeline/`), and repository utilities
- **`snippets/`** — Copy-paste ready cheatsheets and one-liners
- **`templates/`** — Starter configs for Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux, Jenkins, Logstash, syslog-ng, and per-tool scaffolds
- **`environments/`** — Terraform environment configs (dev / staging / prod)
- **`lab/`** — Mini-projects and learning sandboxes
- **`assets/`** — Architecture diagrams and workflow illustrations
- **`.github/`** — CODEOWNERS, PR template, and Dependabot config

Per-tool content folders follow a consistent shape — `notes/`, `scripts/`, `configs/`, `snippets/`, plus wherever useful `docs/`, `manifests/`, `dockerfiles/`, `notebooks/`, `policies/`, or `templates/`:

Trivy, Nuclei, Semgrep, Checkov, tfsec, Terrascan, Grype, Syft, TruffleHog, Gitleaks, GitGuardian, Snyk, Terraform, CodeQL, ZAP, Cosign, Falco, Tetragon, OPA, Vault, Ansible, ArgoCD, Dependabot, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, Helm, Kubernetes, Kustomize, OpenTofu, Prometheus, Grafana, DefectDojo, SonarQube, Linux, Assets, and Lab.

_Grype's notes carry no `last_verified` front-matter, so its column reads —. Totals above are the files inside each category folder; a few folders also hold files at their root or in project sub-folders (Terraform's EventBridge sample, Lab's mini-projects, Environments' dev/staging/prod Terraform, and Assets' diagrams), which the category columns don't itemise._

## Status

Foundational concept primers and practice exercises are complete across the toolchain, and per-tool quickstarts are being rounded out. Recent work went into ZAP DAST integration — a CI/CD pipeline manifest gating merges on scan results, a migration guide consolidating scattered scan config into one Automation Framework plan, and a reference covering baseline, plan-driven, and API-driven patterns. Current focus is DAST pipeline depth and per-tool quickstart coverage.
