> **New here? Start at [the learning path](00_index/learning-path.md).** It walks you from first-contact to confident in a sensible order — read that before this table.

## Who this is for

A working devops and devsecops engineer's quick-reference: first-contact notes, runnable snippets, and configs for the tools you reach for every day. Use it as a shelf you grab from, not a tutorial site. It deliberately does not try to replace each tool's official docs.

## What's in here

939 files across 32 tool-specific folders plus cross-cutting docs, scripts, snippets, templates, and lab environments. Covers vulnerability scanning, secret detection, SBOMs, supply chain security, runtime security, policy engines, infrastructure automation, and observability. Every entry is scenario-grounded and designed to be adapted for real infrastructure work.

## Quick links

- [Snyk vulnerability prioritization doc](snyk/docs/vulnerability-prioritization-reachability-fix-prs-license-compliance.md) — Reachability analysis, Fix PRs, and license compliance for Snyk SCA findings
- [Gatekeeper production deployment manifest](opa/manifests/gatekeeper-production-deployment.yaml) — Production-ready Gatekeeper constraints and templates
- [Vault Secrets Engine Selection Guide](vault/docs/vault-secrets-engine-selection-guide.md) — Comparing KV, database, and cloud secrets engines for common workloads
- [First Vault secret CLI snippet](vault/snippets/2026-08-30-first-vault-secret.sh) — Write and read back a secret using the Vault dev server
- [Snyk multi-language scanning scaffold](snyk/templates/snyk-multilang-scan-scaffold/README.md) — Reusable CI scaffold for scanning polyglot codebases with a shared policy

## Layout

- **`00_index/`** — Navigation: topic map, quick links, glossary, learning path
- **`docs/`** — Concepts, how-to guides, reference, runbooks, security docs, troubleshooting, and setup guides
- **`scripts/`** — Shell toolkits organised by tool (`scripts/bash/`), deployment and rollback wrappers (`scripts/pipeline/`), and repository utilities
- **`snippets/`** — Copy-paste ready cheatsheets and one-liners
- **`templates/`** — Starter configs for Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux, Jenkins, Logstash, syslog-ng
- **`environments/`** — Terraform environment configs (dev / staging / prod)
- **`lab/`** — Mini-projects and learning sandboxes
- **`assets/`** — Architecture diagrams and workflow illustrations
- **`.github/`** — CODEOWNERS, PR template, and Dependabot config

Per-tool content folders follow a consistent shape — `notes/`, `scripts/`, `configs/`, `snippets/`, plus wherever useful `docs/`, `manifests/`, `dockerfiles/`, `notebooks/`, `policies/`, or `templates/`:

Trivy, Semgrep, Checkov, Grype, Syft, TruffleHog, GitGuardian, Snyk, Terrascan, Terraform, CodeQL, ZAP, Cosign, Falco, Tetragon, OPA, Vault, Ansible, ArgoCD, Dependabot, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, Helm, Kubernetes, Kustomize, OpenTofu, Prometheus, Grafana, DefectDojo, SonarQube, and Linux.

## Status

Foundational concept primers and practice exercises are complete across the toolchain, and per-tool quickstarts are being rounded out. Recent work has focused on Snyk vulnerability prioritization, multi-language scanning scaffolds, and Gatekeeper production deployment manifests. Current focus is finishing the remaining per-tool notes and deepening policy-as-code and supply-chain coverage.
