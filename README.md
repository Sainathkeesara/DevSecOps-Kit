> **New here? Start at [the learning path](00_index/learning-path.md).** It walks you from first-contact to confident in a sensible order — read that before this table.

## Who this is for

A working devops and devsecops engineer's quick-reference: first-contact notes, runnable snippets, and configs for the tools you reach for every day. Use it as a shelf you grab from, not a tutorial site. It deliberately does not try to replace each tool's official docs.

## What's in here

Scope runs from Linux and Git fundamentals up through infrastructure as code and Kubernetes delivery, then into the security tooling that rides on top of it: Trivy, Syft, Grype, Checkov, tfsec, Terrascan, Semgrep, CodeQL, SonarQube, ZAP, Nuclei, Cosign, Falco, Tetragon, OPA, Vault, and the secret scanners — TruffleHog, Gitleaks, and GitGuardian. Cross-cutting layers hold the concept primers, how-to guides, runbooks, shell toolkits, cheatsheets, and starter templates that the per-tool folders lean on. Every entry is written to be adapted for real infrastructure work rather than read end to end.

## Quick links

- [Snyk project configuration template](snyk/configs/snyk-project-configuration-template.yaml) — Per-project Snyk settings in one place: severity gate, scan targets, exclusions with reasons, and the ignore-policy pointer for multi-target repos
- [Choosing between CLI and API modes in Snyk](snyk/notebooks/cli-vs-api-modes.ipynb) — When to run a scan through the CLI versus the HTTP API: who can call each, how results are consumed, and how failures surface
- [Exploring the Snyk CLI](snyk/notes/2026-10-07-explore-snyk-cli-commands.md) — `test` versus `monitor` side by side, plus the JSON, monorepo, and severity-gate flags used for CI gating
- [Following the Gitleaks quickstart](gitleaks/notes/2026-10-07-quickstart-trip-ups.md) — Full-history versus staged-changes scans rehearsed against a throwaway repo with a fake credential
- [Checkov health check and rollback](checkov/scripts/checkov-health-check-and-rollback.sh) — One entry point for a Checkov scan gate: prove the scanner runs, classify the latest scan result, and undo a bad scan-gate change by restoring the previous Checkov configuration

_Counts are the files inside each category folder; a few folders also hold files at their root or in project sub-folders (Terraform's EventBridge sample, Lab's mini-projects, Environments' dev/staging/prod Terraform, and Assets' diagrams), which the category columns don't itemise. `Last verified` is the most recent `last_verified` marker anywhere in that tool's files._

## Status

Primers and first-contact notes are complete across the toolchain, so the depth work is operational rather than introductory. Recent additions went after the places a security toolchain actually gets hard: the loop around a vulnerability scan — target choice, database caching, report retention, and diffing against the last accepted result — the moves teams make when adopting or replacing secret scanning, and running a single Gatekeeper ConstraintTemplate across dev, staging, and prod without breaking promotion order or fail-closed enforcement. The newest Snyk additions stay on the operational thread: a per-project configuration template recording severity gate, targets, and exclusions in one place, a notebook weighing CLI runs against API-driven scans, and a CLI walkthrough of `test` versus `monitor` for CI gating. Gitleaks gained a quickstart trip-ups note covering full-history versus staged-changes scans. The thinner corners are the tools carrying notes only: tfsec, Nuclei, and Prometheus.
