## Who this is for

A working devops and devsecops engineer's quick-reference: first-contact notes, runnable snippets, and configs for the tools you reach for every day. Use it as a shelf you grab from, not a tutorial site. It deliberately does not try to replace each tool's official docs.

## What's in here

1074 files across 35 tool folders, plus cross-cutting docs, scripts, snippets, templates, and lab environments. The toolchain runs from Linux and Git fundamentals up through Kubernetes delivery, then into the security tooling that rides on top of it: Trivy, Syft, Grype, Checkov, tfsec, Terrascan, Semgrep, CodeQL, ZAP, Nuclei, SonarQube, Cosign, Falco, Tetragon, OPA, Vault, and the secret scanners. Every entry is scenario-grounded and designed to be adapted for real infrastructure work.

## Quick links

- [Asset index](assets/configs/2026-09-29-asset-index.yaml) — Which diagram file is which size, and where each one is referenced from
- [Image optimisation trip-ups](assets/notes/2026-09-29-image-optimization-tripped-me-up.md) — Keeping aspect ratio when resizing diagrams, and getting relative image links right from nested notes
- [Semgrep rule-design comparison](semgrep/notebooks/rule-matching-mode-comparison.ipynb) — Search, context-constrained, and taint rules for the same injection class scored on one labelled corpus
- [Shell automation with Git hooks](docs/concepts/linux-shell-fundamentals/combining-shell-automation-with-git-hooks.md) — Per-step wrapping, exit-code discipline, and idempotent checks firing at the right point in the commit cycle
- [Version-control patterns in real projects](docs/concepts/version-control-with-git/notebooks/version-control-patterns-in-real-projects.ipynb) — Feature-branch, trunk-based, and squash-merge histories compared through the same Git queries

## Layout

- **`00_index/`** — Navigation: topic map, quick links, glossary, learning path
- **`docs/`** — Concepts, how-to guides, reference, runbooks, security docs, troubleshooting, and setup guides
- **`scripts/`** — Shell toolkits organised by domain (`scripts/bash/`), deployment and rollback wrappers (`scripts/pipeline/`), and repository utilities
- **`snippets/`** — Copy-paste ready cheatsheets and one-liners
- **`templates/`** — Starter configs for Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux, Jenkins, Logstash, syslog-ng, and per-tool scaffolds
- **`environments/`** — Terraform environment configs (dev / staging / prod)
- **`lab/`** — Mini-projects and learning sandboxes
- **`assets/`** — Architecture diagrams and workflow illustrations
- **`.github/`** — CODEOWNERS, PR template, and Dependabot config

Per-tool content folders follow a consistent shape — `notes/`, `scripts/`, `configs/`, `snippets/`, plus wherever useful `docs/`, `manifests/`, `dockerfiles/`, `notebooks/`, `policies/`, or `templates/`:

Trivy, Nuclei, Semgrep, Checkov, tfsec, Terrascan, Grype, Syft, TruffleHog, Gitleaks, GitGuardian, Snyk, Terraform, CodeQL, ZAP, Cosign, Falco, Tetragon, OPA, Vault, Ansible, ArgoCD, Dependabot, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, Helm, Kubernetes, Kustomize, OpenTofu, Prometheus, Grafana, DefectDojo, SonarQube, Linux, and Lab.

_Grype's notes carry no `last_verified` front-matter, so its column reads —. Totals above are the files inside each category folder; a few tools also hold files at the folder root or in project sub-folders (Terraform's EventBridge sample, Lab's mini-projects, Environments' dev/staging/prod Terraform, Checkov's `.checkov.yaml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`), which the category columns don't itemise._

## Status

Foundational concept primers and practice exercises are complete across the toolchain, and per-tool quickstarts are being rounded out. Recent additions cover a Semgrep rule-design comparison (search vs context-constrained vs taint on one labelled corpus), a guide to combining shell automation with Git hooks, a version-control-patterns notebook, and an index plus optimisation notes for the kit's architecture diagrams. Current focus is Semgrep rule-writing depth and Linux/Git fundamentals practice material.
