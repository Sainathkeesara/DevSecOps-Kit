## Who this is for

A working devops and devsecops engineer's quick-reference: first-contact notes, runnable snippets, and configs for the tools you reach for every day. Use it as a shelf you grab from, not a tutorial site. It deliberately does not try to replace each tool's official docs.

## What's in here

1087 files across 41 tool and content folders — 38 tools, plus the cross-cutting `docs/`, `scripts/`, `snippets/`, `templates/`, and `environments/` layers. The toolchain runs from Linux and Git fundamentals up through Kubernetes delivery, then into the security tooling that rides on top of it: Trivy, Syft, Grype, Checkov, tfsec, Terrascan, Semgrep, CodeQL, ZAP, Nuclei, SonarQube, Cosign, Falco, Tetragon, OPA, Vault, and the secret scanners. Every entry is scenario-grounded and designed to be adapted for real infrastructure work.

## Quick links

## Layout

- **`00_index/`** — Navigation: topic map, quick links, glossary, learning path
- **`docs/`** — Concepts, how-to guides, reference, runbooks, security docs, troubleshooting, and setup guides
- **`scripts/`** — Shell toolkits organised by domain (`scripts/bash/`), deployment and rollback wrappers (`scripts/pipeline/`), and repository utilities
- **`snippets/`** — Copy-paste ready cheatsheets and one-liners
- **`templates/`** — Starter configs for Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux, Jenkins, Logstash, syslog-ng, and per-tool scaffolds
- **`environments/`** — Terraform environment configs (dev / staging / prod)
- **`lab/`** — Mini-projects and learning sandboxes
- **`assets/`** — Architecture diagrams and workflow illustrations
- **`.github/`** — CODEOWNERS, PR template, and Dependabot config

Per-tool content folders follow a consistent shape — `notes/`, `scripts/`, `configs/`, `snippets/`, plus wherever useful `docs/`, `manifests/`, `dockerfiles/`, `notebooks/`, `policies/`, or `templates/`:

Trivy, Nuclei, Semgrep, Checkov, tfsec, Terrascan, Grype, Syft, TruffleHog, Gitleaks, GitGuardian, Snyk, Terraform, CodeQL, ZAP, Cosign, Falco, Tetragon, OPA, Vault, Ansible, ArgoCD, Dependabot, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, Helm, Kubernetes, Kustomize, OpenTofu, Prometheus, Grafana, DefectDojo, SonarQube, Linux, Assets, and Lab.

_Grype's notes carry no `last_verified` front-matter, so its column reads —. Totals above are the files inside each category folder; a few folders also hold files at their root or in project sub-folders (Terraform's EventBridge sample, Lab's mini-projects, Environments' dev/staging/prod Terraform, and Assets' diagrams), which the category columns don't itemise._

## Status

Primers and per-tool quickstarts are complete across most of the toolchain, and the depth work is now in integration patterns rather than first contact. Recent additions went into runtime security — a Falco deployment walkthrough covering custom rules, priority routing, and alert forwarding, plus a notebook weighing Falco's syscall rule engine against eBPF probes — and into secret-scanning pipelines with a GitGuardian CI/CD integration guide. Current focus is runtime detection depth and pipeline integrations for the security scanners.
