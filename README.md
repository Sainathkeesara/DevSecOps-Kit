> **New here? Start at [the learning path](00_index/learning-path.md).** It walks you from first-contact to confident in a sensible order — read that before this table.

## Who this is for

A working devops and devsecops engineer's quick-reference: first-contact notes, runnable snippets, and configs for the tools you reach for every day. Use it as a shelf you grab from, not a tutorial site. It deliberately does not try to replace each tool's official docs.

## What's in here

Scope runs from Linux and Git fundamentals up through infrastructure as code and Kubernetes delivery, then into the security tooling that rides on top of it: Trivy, Syft, Grype, Checkov, tfsec, Terrascan, Semgrep, CodeQL, SonarQube, ZAP, Nuclei, Cosign, Falco, Tetragon, OPA, Vault, and the secret scanners — TruffleHog, Gitleaks, and GitGuardian. Cross-cutting layers hold the concept primers, how-to guides, runbooks, shell toolkits, cheatsheets, and starter templates that the per-tool folders lean on. Every entry is written to be adapted for real infrastructure work rather than read end to end.

## Quick links

- [Correcting the assets claim in my environments note](environments/notes/2026-10-14-architecture-overview-claim-fix.md) — Re-reading the comparison note showed it references no files at all, so the explore note's assets sentence was fixed in place
- [Deduping the observability primer](prometheus/notes/2026-10-14-observability-primer-dedup.md) — The Prometheus copy was byte-identical to the concept primer, so it was removed and the concept copy kept as canonical
- [Fixing the scripts/lib claim](scripts/notes/2026-10-14-lib-claim-fix.md) — No `lib/` directory exists under `scripts/`, so the README's shared-libraries section was corrected instead of building the modules
- [My first namespace](kubernetes/configs/2026-10-14-minimal-namespace.yaml) — A minimal labelled scratch namespace to try things in
- [Poking at the cluster — what resources are even here](kubernetes/notes/2026-10-14-cluster-resources.md) — `api-resources`, what `get all` leaves out, and the namespaces on a first look around

## Layout

- **`00_index/`** — Navigation: topic map, quick links, glossary, learning path
- **`docs/`** — Concepts, how-to guides, reference, runbooks, security docs, troubleshooting, setup guides, and `docs/notes/`
- **`scripts/`** — Shell toolkits organised by domain (`scripts/bash/`), deployment and rollback wrappers (`scripts/pipeline/`), and repository utilities, plus `scripts/notes/` and `scripts/snippets/`
- **`snippets/`** — Copy-paste ready cheatsheets and one-liners, plus `snippets/configs/`, `snippets/notes/`, and `snippets/snippets/`
- **`templates/`** — Starter configs for Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux, Jenkins, Logstash, syslog-ng, and per-tool scaffolds, plus `templates/configs/`, `templates/notes/`, and `templates/templates/`
- **`environments/`** — Terraform environment configs (dev / staging / prod)
- **`lab/`** — Mini-projects and learning sandboxes
- **`assets/`** — Architecture diagrams and workflow illustrations
- **`.github/`** — CODEOWNERS, PR template, and Dependabot config

_Counts are the files inside each category folder; a few folders also hold files at their root or in project sub-folders (Terraform's EventBridge sample, Lab's mini-projects, Environments' dev/staging/prod Terraform, and Assets' diagrams), which the category columns don't itemise. `Last verified` is the most recent `last_verified` marker anywhere in that tool's files._

## Status

First-contact notes are still landing where the kit was thin: a first look at cluster resources and a first scratch namespace for Kubernetes, a first SBOM snippet for Syft, a first Rego policy mirrored in Python for OPA, and a first query log plus an audit of the Gitleaks flow. Alongside that, a round of claim-fixing corrected stale sentences in the environments and scripts notes against what's actually on disk. The thinner corners are still the tools carrying notes only: tfsec and Nuclei.
