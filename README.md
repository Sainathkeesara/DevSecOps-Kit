## Who this is for

A working devops and devsecops engineer's quick-reference: first-contact notes, runnable snippets, and configs for the tools you reach for every day. Use it as a shelf you grab from, not a tutorial site. It deliberately does not try to replace each tool's official docs.

## What's in here

1083 files across 38 tool and content folders, plus cross-cutting docs, scripts, snippets, templates, and lab environments. The toolchain runs from Linux and Git fundamentals up through Kubernetes delivery, then into the security tooling that rides on top of it: Trivy, Syft, Grype, Checkov, tfsec, Terrascan, Semgrep, CodeQL, ZAP, Nuclei, SonarQube, Cosign, Falco, Tetragon, OPA, Vault, and the secret scanners. Every entry is scenario-grounded and designed to be adapted for real infrastructure work.

## Quick links

- [Environments quickstart trip-ups](environments/notes/2026-09-30-environments-quickstart-trip-ups.md) — Why a plan run in `staging/` reads dev's state file, and the other three things that stop the per-environment loop
- [Minimal per-tier environments config](environments/configs/2026-09-30-minimal-environments-config.yaml) — Only the values that differ between dev, staging, and prod, with the intended state key per tier
- [Assets directory walkthrough](assets/notes/2026-09-30-explore-assets-directory.md) — What the diagram store holds today and how docs reference it
- [Semgrep rules migration guide](semgrep/docs/semgrep-rules-migration-guide.md) — Moving an organically grown ruleset into a consistent layout with normalized envelopes and a CI rollout
- [Explore the environments directory](environments/notes/2026-09-29-explore-environments-directory.md) — Primer, three-environment comparison, and minimal variable-set config on disk

## Layout

- **`00_index/`** — Navigation: topic map, quick links, glossary, learning path
- **`docs/`** — Concepts, how-to guides, reference, runbooks, security docs, troubleshooting, and setup guides
- **`scripts/`** — Shell toolkits organised by domain (`scripts/bash/`), deployment and rollback wrappers (`scripts/pipeline/`), and repository utilities
- **`snippets/`** — Copy-paste ready cheatsheets and one-liners
- **`templates/`** — Starter configs for Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux, Jenkins, Logstash, syslog-ng, and per-tool scaffolds
- **`environments/`** — Terraform environment configs (dev / staging / prod)
- **`lab/`** — Mini-projects and learning sandboxes
- **`assets/`** — Architecture diagrams and workflow illustrations
- **`.github/`** — CODEOWNERS, PR template, and Dependabot config

Per-tool content folders follow a consistent shape — `notes/`, `scripts/`, `configs/`, `snippets/`, plus wherever useful `docs/`, `manifests/`, `dockerfiles/`, `notebooks/`, `policies/`, or `templates/`:

Trivy, Nuclei, Semgrep, Checkov, tfsec, Terrascan, Grype, Syft, TruffleHog, Gitleaks, GitGuardian, Snyk, Terraform, CodeQL, ZAP, Cosign, Falco, Tetragon, OPA, Vault, Ansible, ArgoCD, Dependabot, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, Helm, Kubernetes, Kustomize, OpenTofu, Prometheus, Grafana, DefectDojo, SonarQube, Linux, Assets, and Lab.

_Grype's notes carry no `last_verified` front-matter, so its column reads —. Totals above are the files inside each category folder; a few folders also hold files at their root or in project sub-folders (Terraform's EventBridge sample, Lab's mini-projects, Environments' dev/staging/prod Terraform, and Assets' diagrams), which the category columns don't itemise._

## Status

Foundational concept primers and practice exercises are complete across the toolchain, and per-tool quickstarts are being rounded out. Recent work went into the environments material — a quickstart write-up on the shared state key and duplicated output blocks, and a minimal per-tier config that records both the key as written and the key each tier needs. Current focus is IaC environment isolation and per-tool quickstart depth.
